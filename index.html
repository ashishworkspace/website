<br />
<div data-v-101110cb="" class="poem__body px-md-4 font-serif"><p><span class="long-line">Whose woods these are I think I know.</span><br><span class="long-line">His house is in the village though;</span><br><span class="long-line">He will not see me stopping here</span><br><span class="long-line">To watch his woods fill up with snow.</span></p>

<p><span class="long-line">My little horse must think it queer</span><br><span class="long-line">To stop without a farmhouse near</span><br><span class="long-line">Between the woods and frozen lake</span><br><span class="long-line">The darkest evening of the year.</span></p>

<p><span class="long-line">He gives his harness bells a shake</span><br><span class="long-line">To ask if there is some mistake.</span><br><span class="long-line">The only other sound's the sweep</span><br><span class="long-line">Of easy wind and downy flake.</span></p>

<p><span class="long-line">The woods are lovely, dark&nbsp;and deep.</span><br><span class="long-line">But I have promises to keep,</span><br><span class="long-line">And miles to go before I sleep,</span><br><span class="long-line">And miles to go before I sleep.</span></p>
